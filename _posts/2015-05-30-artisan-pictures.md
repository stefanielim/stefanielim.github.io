<p>
  <a href="http://www.artisan-pictures.co.uk">Artisan Pictures</a> is a London-based media production company who I made a custom Wordpress theme for. They create documentaries for television and the web, as well as produce bespoke audio-visual content for charities, museums and educational institutions.
</p>

<p>
  Given that their aim was to promote their work, we opted for a grid-based layout of thumbnails for the homepage and a simple site design to keep the focus on their work. The site is also fully responsive with the theme built using HTML, CSS, PHP and jQuery/JavaScript.
