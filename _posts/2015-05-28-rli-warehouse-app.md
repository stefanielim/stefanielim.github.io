<p>I developed a web app for Rudolf Lietz Inc., a trading company based in Manila, Philippines, to help manage and monitor the company's product inventory. In particular, they wanted to be able to monitor the conditions of their products while in storage and be able to check upon these remotely on a tablet. Given the data-heavy nature of the app, I dealt a lot with MySQL and had to organise the data properly in order to effectively structure the app. </p>

<p>The functionalities of the app include, but are not limited to:
<ul>
  <li>Create, read, update and delete (CRUD) functionalities for product purchases, as well as storage units and facilities</li>
  <li>Allows daily inspections of products to be made and viewed, both as batch and individual forms</li>
  <li>Has support for photo uploads for product inspections</li>
  <li>Provides inspection reports and at-a-glance views of the companyâ€™s inventory, given selected filters</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The app was built on WordPress using a pre-made theme and coded with PHP, HTML, CSS and jQuery.</p>
