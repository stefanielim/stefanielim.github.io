<p>T<sup>3</sup> is a Ruby-based tic-tac-toe web app I built after four weeks of coding at General Assembly's Web Development Immersive course. Users can sign up or log in and play a game of tic-tac-toe against another user or against the computer. An extra feature I added, however, is that the user isn't limited by a 3x3 grid but can select the grid size of their choice.</p>

</div>

<p>What I enjoyed most about creating the app was challenging myself to go beyond the 3x3 grid and figure out a way to dynamically determine a game's win conditions so that the app can work with (theoretically) any grid size, rather than just hard coding, say, the standard win conditions of the 3x3 grid.</p>

<p>Technologies used: Ruby on Rails with HTML and Foundation (as the front-end framework).</p>
