<p><a href="http://cheerupme.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">cheerup.me</a> is a Twitter-like web app wherein users can post and share 'Cheerups' - 141 character messages to brighten people's days. They can also vote on their favourite (or least favourite) cheerups which will then affect the prominence of the poster.</p>

<p>This app was built in a week as a group project with <a href="http://katemont.com" target="_blank">Kate Montgomery</a> and <a href="https://github.com/aduddella" target="_blank">Anand Duddella</a> after seven weeks of coding in General Assembly's Web Development Immersive course. My main responsibilites include developing the front-end of the app (design and animation of the Cheerups) as well as the voting and user prominence features of the app.</p>
