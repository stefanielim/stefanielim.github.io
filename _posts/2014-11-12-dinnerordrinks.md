<p><a href="http://dinnerordrinks.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">dinnerordrinks</a> is a social event planning app that aims to make organising meetups with friends as simple as possible. The idea behind the app was to try and address two fundamental issues with trying to organise events: deciding when and where the event should take place.</p>

<p><a href="http://shehryarriaz.com" target="_blank">Shehryar Riaz</a> and I decided to build this app together as we both found it difficult trying to coordinate the busy schedules among our friend groups and tried to understand why this was so tricky. The resultant thought was 'Why don't we make an app to solve that?' Given the social aspect of the app, we decided to design the app mobile-first so that dinnerordrinks could be accessed on the go.</p>
<p>This app was built in two weeks as part of my time as a student in General Assembly's Web Development Immersive course after ten weeks of coding.</p>

<p>Technologies used: Ruby on Rails with jQuery, AJAX, HAML, Google Maps API and Bootstrap (as the front-end framework).</p>
