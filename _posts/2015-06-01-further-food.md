<p>
  I've been currently working as a WordPress developer for NY-based company, <a href="http://www.furtherfood.com">Further Food</a>, helping them build the next version of their website. The focus of my work is to make the site responsive and help improve the front-end and user experience of the site in order to increase traffic. For this project, I've been coding in HTML, CSS, PHP and jQuery/JavaScript. 
</p>

<p>Further Food is the world's largest crowd-sourced, curated discovery platform of recipes, meal plans and stories built by and for people with health conditions. Its mission is to help people discover how to use food to heal and prevent disease. Currently transitioning to the new version, you can view Further Food's site at <a href="http://www.furtherfood.com">www.furtherfood.com</a></p>
