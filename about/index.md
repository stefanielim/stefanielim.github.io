As a former chemist, I’ve always had a passion for learning. I enjoy understanding how things work and challenging myself to expand my skill set. Prior to joining GA and deciding to be a coder, I lived in several different countries and had experience working in research and development for a multinational chemical company. As part of my role, I was able to build upon my problem-solving and analytical skills but felt an increasing desire for opportunities where I could develop products more collaboratively with others. As a recent graduate of GA, I have found the learning process to be incredibly rewarding, particularly having built several apps along the way, both individually and as part of team. I can’t wait to be able to further this experience and join a likeminded, agile development team.
