  <div id="site-about-content">
    <p>As a former chemist, Iâ€™ve always had a passion for learning. I enjoy understanding how things work and challenging myself to expand my skill set. Prior to joining General Assembly and deciding to be a coder, I lived in several different countries and had experience working in research and development for multinational chemical companies. As part of my role, I was able to build upon my problem-solving and analytical skills but felt an increasing desire for opportunities where I could develop products more collaboratively with others.</p>

    <p>As a web developer, I find the learning and development process to be incredibly rewarding, partcularly the idea that you can improve upon or build something that directly impacts people's lives. I would love to be able to further this experience in a likeminded, agile development team.</p>
